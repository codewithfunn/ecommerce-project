B A C K E N D :-
--------------
Here first, I make a directory name "backend" then  server.js with different folder likes:- 

1) controllers:- 
--------------
admin, 
user,
2) models:- 
---------
order, 
products, 
custumer,
cart,
category, 
3) middleware:-
--------------
 auth for login checking... Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

4) routes:- 
---------
user, 
admin, 

*********************************************************************************


then, I install some packages:-
-----------------------------
1) "bcryptjs": bcryptjs is a JavaScript library used primarily for hashing passwords. It employs the bcrypt hashing algorithm to securely hash passwords, making them difficult to reverse engineer or decrypt.

2) "cors": cors (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a node.js package used to enable CORS in a Node.js Express application. CORS is a security feature implemented in web browsers that controls access to resources from different origins. It allows or restricts cross-origin HTTP requests, helping to prevent cross-site request forgery and other security issues.

3) "express":Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features and tools. Here's a basic example demonstrating how Express might be used to create a simple server:

4) "jsonwebtoken":jsonwebtoken is a popular library used in Node.js to generate and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. They are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web development.

5) "mongoose":Mongoose is a popular Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB. It provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model your application data and interact with MongoDB databases.

6) "nodemon":nodemon is a utility for Node.js that monitors changes in your Node.js application files and automatically restarts the server when changes are detected. It's particularly useful during the development phase as it saves you from manually stopping and restarting the server every time you make changes to your code.
